## 1 Introduction
Map Reduce is a programming model and concept which utilizes multiple 
functions to find specific data in huge data sets. In past times
such tasks have been very challenging due to the fact that searching
for relevant data is ovely time and resource consuming. As datasets
are ever growing, conventionally applied methods have become 
insufficient in achiving such data science tasks.
The Map Reduce model is able to fetch the relevant data fast 
by applying multiple functions which can be run asynchronously
on distributed clusters.

The following chapters will deep dive into the concept of map reduce
which is then round up by some real world examples map reduce
has proven to be a good choice for.
