# 6. Summary

The term "Data Science" came from the early sixties where it actually "evolved" from datalogy, but got really spread in the beginning of 2000-ties when the hadware became more powerfull and less expensive.

Apache Spark is the shiny new toy on the Big Data playground, but there are still use cases where Hadoop MapReduce performs better. Spark has excellent performance and is highly cost-effective thanks to in-memory data processing. It is compatible with all of Hadoop’s data sources and file formats, and thanks to friendly APIs that are available in several programming languages, it also has a faster learning curve. Spark even includes graph processing and machine-learning capabilities.

But even if Spark looks like the big winner, the chances are that you would not use it on its own — you still need HDFS to store the data and you may want to use other Hadoop projects. This means you will still need to run Hadoop and MapReduce alongside Spark for a full Big Data package.
